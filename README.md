## In App Purchase 2 Example with Ionic

### This code references this blog post [IAP2 - Medium](https://medium.com/@andrew.thielcole/in-app-purchases-with-ionic-3-af13b21f49f2)


This is an example Ionic application with the full code for configuring and buying a product.
  This will only work in an emulator, and it will also fail because you need to edit a few pieces with
  your google and apple product id's, as well as your google play store code in config.xml</p>
