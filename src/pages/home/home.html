  <h2>Welcome to An In App Purchase 2 Example App!</h2>
  <p>
    This starter project should give you all the code you need to be able to integrate
    the In App Purchase 2 (https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase) Plugin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that this code does not function in this project because you need to integrate it with
    and existing Product from either google or apple to make this work.
